## Getting Started

To use the quiz application, follow these steps:

1. **HTML Structure**: Ensure you have an HTML file with the required structure, including elements with the IDs "question," "answer-buttons," and "next-btn."

2. **JavaScript Code**: Copy and paste the provided JavaScript code into a `<script>` tag or link to an external JavaScript file in your HTML document.

    {
        question: "Which is the largest animal in the world?",
        answers: [
            { text: "Shark", correct: false },
            { text: "Blue whale", correct: true },
            // ... other answer options
        ]
